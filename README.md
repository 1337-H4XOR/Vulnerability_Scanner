# Vulnerability_Scanner
Vulnerability Scanner is a web application scanner used to find specific types of vulnerabilities.
As of now, Vulnerability_Scanner is in its development stage and currently finds the Cross-Site Scripting vulnerablity.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user.

NOTE: This is a project work made by Gaurav Chauhan (that's me ;) ) as a part of my Major Project. This project is specifically target the DAMN VULNERABLE WEB APPLICATION (DVWA).
It covers all the security level of the DAMN VULNERABLE WEB APPLICATION.

USAGE:-
  1. git clone https://github.com/1337-H4XOR/Vulnerability_Scanner.git
  2. python3 vulnerablity_scanner.py

NOTE: In order to use this scanner you need to change the "[Your Machine IP]" tag with the IP of the DVWA's IP and replace the target_url & links_to_ignore variable's parameter accordingly to the DVWA URL.
